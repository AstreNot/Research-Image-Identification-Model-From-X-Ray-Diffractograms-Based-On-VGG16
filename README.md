#Image Identification Model From X-Ray Diffractograms Based On VGG16

This project presents a deep learning approach for identifying material phases using X-ray diffractogram (XRD) images. Leveraging the power of the VGG16 convolutional neural network, the model classifies XRD patterns into specific material categories with the goal of automating phase recognition in material science. By converting diffractograms into images and fine-tuning a pre-trained VGG16 architecture, this project demonstrates how computer vision can enhance traditional material analysis, supporting faster and more scalable research workflows.

The repository includes the dataset preprocessing steps, model training scripts, evaluation metrics, and example predictions.
